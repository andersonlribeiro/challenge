NOT IN USE - Code challenge structure, tasks and result evaluation

## Introduction

Honeypot provides pre-screening of talent which involves:

  * General validation of human language skills, education,
professional experience, availability and desired carrier path

  * Technical screening - code quality, technology and best practice
knowledge

This Repository should serve as a centralised resource for coding
challenges and common consensus on how to evaluate and rate the
results of a challenge.

Everything in this document is based on the assumption
that following holds true:

  * Code is being written once and read many times
