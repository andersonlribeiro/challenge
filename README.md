Code challenge Structure, Tasks and result evaluation

## Introduction

Everything in this document is based on the assumption
that following holds true:

* Code is being written once and read many times

## Evaluation grid

The aim is to create a set of polyglot guidelines for basic code
quality and general work culture evaluation



### Work flow

* Usage of a source control system (eg. GIT, SVN)
* Continuous integration usage (for deploy, testing, quality assurance)
* Documentation (at least a basic README)
* Automated server setup (usage of Chef, Ansible, Saltstack, Docker, Vagrant, ...)
* for using VIM you get extra points (of course) :)

* Communication through issues / pull requests

### Code

* It works (is executable and behaves as specified)
* existence of tests (unit/integration/acceptance)
* method/function length
* class/module length
* Cyclomatic complexity
* Usage of global state
